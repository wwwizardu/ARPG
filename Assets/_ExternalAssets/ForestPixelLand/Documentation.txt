Scripts:

EnemyEntity - Responsible for character animations.Movement.

	In order for the character to somehow react to events on the map, you need to drag the "enemy entity" into the inspector. Also set up colliders like other characters.
	On the Scene, select a character, drag the Graphics, Player (whom he will attack), Enemi (himself) into the character, set the values (Speed, Distance Between, Attack Distance).

EnemyPatrol - Responsible for the character's movement along the X-axis. (patrolling)

	Create an empty element, create a component with a script in it. Drag your character under the element and also two dots (empty elements) with names: leftEdge, rightEdge.

	Example: EnemyPatrol prefab.

Player - Responsible for character movement and animations.

PlayerFlip - Mirroring the character along the X axis, relative to the mouse position on the screen.

Box - Destruction of objects on impact, destruction and animation.

BushShake - Bushes moving when in contact with the character.

Character - Character recognition when colliding with a collider, associated with the "Feder" Script.

Fader/FaderBuildings - Object (sprite) transparency, used for trees and buildings. 

	For the script to work, the object must have a collider with the "triggered" checkbox. Add the "Character" script to your hero.

GateOpens - Opening the gate when the player approaches it, closing it when he moves away (used for the Stone Gates").

	For the script to work, the object must have a collider with the "triggered" checkbox.

SceneTransition - Moving your character around the scene or to another scene.

	Specify in the transition scene where you want to move the character and also by what coordinates, if the scene is different, then a prefab of your character with an attached 
	camera should be prepared there. Example on the Demo scene.
